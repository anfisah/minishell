# minishell

:computer: Minishell is a two-person project at 42.

:question: The objective of this project is to create a simple shell.

For this project I reuse my own standard c librairie and my own printf.

:page_with_curl: You will find the [subject](https://github.com/anfisah/minishell/blob/main/en.subject.pdf) of the project at the root of the repository. Some instructions have changed in the subject but the idea remains the same.

To test the project, make a ```make```. Then, use it like a basic shell.
