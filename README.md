# minishell

Minishell is a two-person project at 42.

The objective of this project is to create a simple shell.

For this project I reuse my own standard c librairie and my own printf.

You will find the subject of the project at the root of the repository. Some instructions have changed in the subject but the idea remains the same.

To test the project, make a make. Then, use it like a basic shell.
